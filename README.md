# Curated List of GCP educational resources

## Online Courses

* [Coursera GCP courses](https://www.coursera.org/courses?query=gcp) Courses provided by both Google and other institutions that use GCP.  [Eligible faculty and students](https://edu.google.com/programs/credits/faqs/?modal_active=none) can get free access to 13 of the Google courses though the [Training Credits Program](https://edu.google.com/programs/credits/training/?modal_active=none).  
* [The Machine Learning Crash Course](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course/) Originally, an on-line public version of the training for Google engineers, this has expanded to numerous classes including problem framing, data prep, and testing and debugging.  Students get hands-on experience using Colab. 

## Books

### Available on-line
* [Mining of Massive Datasets](http://mmds.org/) by Jure Leskovec, Anand Rajaraman, Jeff Ullman.  A book to go with Stanford's 246 class.
* [Cloud Computing for Science and Engineering](https://cloud4scieng.org/) It's getting old (over 2 years), but has some useful background.  See the [Chapters tab](https://cloud4scieng.org/chapters/).

### Not available on-line
* [Data Science on Google Cloud Platform](http://amzn.com/B0787L7RK3) by Valliappa (Lak) Lakshmanan.  This book was distributed to attendees of SIGCSE 2019 and has been useful in a number of classes since then.


## Tutorials

Codelabs and Qwiklabs are self-paced, hands-on tutorials.  Codelabs require students to have their own GCP account whereas Qwiklabs provide a new account for the student for each lab.  [Eligible faculty and students](https://edu.google.com/programs/credits/faqs/?modal_active=none) can get free access to Qwiklabs though the [Training Credits Program](https://edu.google.com/programs/credits/training/?modal_active=none).  

* [GCP codelabs](http://g.co/codelabs/cloud)
* [Other Google codelabs](http://g.co/codelabs)
* [Qwiklabs](http://google.qwiklabs.com)  Along with individual labs, Qwiklabs provides Quests, groupings of individual labs that make sense together.

## Notebooks
Jupyter notebooks are becoming extremely popular in many different classes, especially data science and machine learning.

* [Google Colab](http://colab.research.google.com) A hosting platform for notebooks that provides access to GPUs and TPUs, with numerous instructional notebooks on how to use Colab.
* [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/docs/kernels#notebooks) Kaggle provides hosting of Juptyer notebooks and so much more.  There are numerous public data sets, notebooks that provide [microcourses](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/overview) in numerous topics (such as Python, Machine Learning, and SQL) to help students, competitions, and the ability for faculty to run [their own competitions](https://www.kaggle.com/about/inclass/overview). 
* [AI Platform Notebooks](https://cloud.google.com/ai-platform-notebooks/) An enterprise notebook solution that interfaces quickly and easily with GCP tools such as BigQuery, Cloud Dataproc, and Cloud Dataflow.
* [Cloud Datalab](https://cloud.google.com/datalab/docs/how-to/working-with-notebooks) Another GCP tool to provide a notebook server.
* [Seedbank](https://research.google.com/seedbank/) A collection of interactive Machine Learning examples, designed to be used in Colab.

## Resources
GCP has a number of different grant programs, listed below.

* [GCP teaching grants](https://edu.google.com/programs/credits/teaching/)
* [GCP research grants](https://edu.google.com/programs/credits/research/)
* [QwikLabs credits](https://edu.google.com/programs/credits/training/)
* [Career readiness track](https://edu.google.com/programs/credits/career-readiness/)

Here's a quick comparison of those programs.

## Solutions and Course Materials
There are many faculty who share much of their course material on-line.  These include the following:
* [The Database Whisperer](https://github.com/hymanphd/Database-Whisperer-Docs) Materials to go with Harvey Hyman's ISM 4212 course at USF.
* [ART350 video experimentation toolkit](https://github.com/realtechsupport/ActionCameraCode) Materials from the Department of Art at the University of Buffalo.
